# Caching, Memoization, And Request Dedupe

Use `effect/Cache` when its keyed memoization, TTL, capacity, lifecycle, and eviction semantics fit. When it fits, do not hand-roll `Map`/TTL/prune caches, in-flight deduplication maps, or LRU logic.

## Core Rules

- `Cache.make({ capacity, lookup, timeToLive })` caches per-key lookups with one fixed TTL for all entries.
- Concurrent `Cache.get` calls for the same missing key share one pending lookup; use that behavior for in-flight deduplication.
- `capacity` is required and supplies the cache's eviction bound.
- `Cache.invalidate(cache, key)` and `Cache.refresh(cache, key)` handle explicit staleness; `Cache.has` checks without triggering a lookup.
- Cache construction is effectful. Build each cache once in its owning Layer or Scope and share the handle.
- For a single value without a key, use `Effect.cached(effect)` or `Effect.cachedWithTTL(effect, ttl)`.
- For cached resources that need cleanup, such as connections or clients, use `ScopedCache`.

## Exit-Aware TTL

`Cache.makeWith(lookup, { capacity, timeToLive(exit, key) })` computes each entry's TTL from the lookup's `Exit`. Give transient failures and degraded fallbacks a zero TTL (`0`, `"0 millis"`, or `Duration.zero`) so the caller receives the result while the next lookup can try again. A short negative-cache TTL can protect an upstream from repeated stable failures such as not-found results.

```ts
import { Cache, Duration, Effect, Exit } from "effect"

const makeResolver = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const cache = yield* Cache.makeWith(
    (channelRef: string) => resolveUncached(channelRef), // returns { where, cacheable }
    {
      capacity: 300,
      timeToLive: (exit) =>
        Exit.isSuccess(exit) && exit.value.cacheable ? "10 minutes" : Duration.zero,
    },
  )
  return (channelRef: string) =>
    Cache.get(cache, channelRef).pipe(Effect.map((resolved) => resolved.where))
})
```

## Acquire Expensive Clients Once

Acquire stable clients once in their owning Layer or Scope, then reuse them only while that runtime context remains valid. A request-bound handle belongs to the current invocation, not an isolate-wide Layer/cache; a canonical cache key does not extend its I/O lifetime. When Alchemy bindings or Durable Object clients are involved, read [invocation-owned clients](effect-alchemy.md#invocation-owned-clients). Also apply [`effect-services.md`](effect-services.md) when construction changes.

## Request Batching (`Effect.request` + `RequestResolver`)

A `RequestResolver` batches pending requests when one backend call can answer multiple keys, such as SQL `IN (...)`, DataLoader-style endpoints, or batch GET. Per-item endpoints use `Effect.forEach(items, f, { concurrency: n })`, optionally through a `Cache` for deduplication and memoization.

`RequestResolver.batchN(resolver, n)` bounds batch size; `RequestResolver.makeGrouped` groups requests that resolve through different targets.

Selection guide:

- Same key requested repeatedly over time → `Cache`.
- Same key requested concurrently in one burst → `Cache` (shared pending lookup).
- Many distinct keys, backend has a batch endpoint → `Effect.request` + `RequestResolver`.
- Many distinct keys, per-item endpoint only → `Effect.forEach(..., { concurrency: n })`, optionally through a `Cache`.

## Completion Check

For every cache or batching path, the chosen primitive matches the key pattern and backend; each keyed cache has an intentional capacity, TTL and invalidation policy, and lifetime owner; stable dependencies are acquired once; same-key concurrency uses built-in deduplication; and each `RequestResolver` maps multiple keys to one backend call.
